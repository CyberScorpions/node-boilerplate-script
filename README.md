# Node.js boilerplate generator

This script generates the necessary structure for a scalable Node.js application.
The script performs the following operations:
- initialize npm
- create folders and files
- download commonly used packages
- write boilerplate code to files

After the script is ran, you will have a Node.js application that can be run without any additional configuration.
Certain features could be considered optional but are additions that I add to all my projects (such as Bluebird for promises). An example route and Mongoose model are also included to provide a simple template for getting started.

The `example` folder contains the generated boilerplate from using this script.
